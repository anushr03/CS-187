# Website Login Information

Overview

In this project, you’ll exercise your understanding of how a hashtable functions to store key-value pairs. You’ll implement a hashtable with different probing methodologies to resolve collisions. You will use your hashtable implementation as a storage for login credentials, username and password, for a website. This is a service that all websites use to create and manage user accounts.
