In this project, you will complete several methods in the ArrayListServices class that provide useful operations on ArrayLists. This project is designed as both a Java review/warm up, an opportunity to code list processing algorithms, as an introduction to the use of generic data types, and as an exercise to learn to adhere to a style guide.
