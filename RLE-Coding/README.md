# RLE Encoding

Overview

For this project, you will implement Run Length Encoding, or RLE, an algorithm that encodes ascii data in a compressed format. Given a text file containing an image constructed with ascii characters, RLE will encode the file in compressed form. Given a file with data in RLE compressed form, you will be able to decompress the file and recover the exact image that was originally compressed. You will use arrays as the basic data structures to implement the RLE compression and decompression algorithms.
