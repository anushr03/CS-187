# Graph Coloring

Overview

Many real-world problems can be represented by graphs and solved by applying various algorithms to the graph (GPS navigation, utility networks, social networks are just some of the systems that rely on graphs). In this assignment, you will implement a graph structure and a graph coloring algorithm. You will then use the graph and graph-coloring algorithm to solve various problems involving conflict resolution and finding an optimal assignment of resources to accomplish a task or goal.
