# Bucket Sort

Overview

Most sorting algorithms you encounter are designed to be “general purpose” sorts, where any data type can be sorted as long as a method for comparing them is defined. In Java, this method is called “​compareTo​” in the C​ omparable​ interface. Any class that implements Comparable​ can be sorted because they can be compared.

There are other sorting algorithms that do not rely on comparing data directly. These are not general purpose in the sense that they have to be customized for different types of data. In this project you will implement one of these sorting algorithms called Bucket Sort. The version of Bucket Sort will be customized to work with integers, but it could work with any symbolic language.
