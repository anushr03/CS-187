# BST

Overview

In this assignment, you’ll start with a codebase for a binary search tree (BST), which has an ordering property that any node's left subtree keys ≤ the node's key, and the right subtree's keys ≥ the node's key. That property enables fast searching for an item. You’ll need to implement several methods for the binary search tree code given to you.
